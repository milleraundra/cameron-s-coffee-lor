# Cameron's Coffee #2
#### By Michael Lor, Aundra Miller, and Nic Netzel

##Description
This is a Drupal website for Cameron's Coffee Shop. The project was used mainly to practice creating custom modules.

##Required Modules
For the custom modules to function appropriately, the following modules are required:
* `disable_messages` for comment_buddy module

##Bugs
The code for user login and logout in the user_greetings custom module is incomplete. For full functionality, it must also handle users reseting their password.
